Solar is a Paper Plugin for Minecraft.

The goal of Solar is to create a simple and easy customization of the day and night cycle for worlds.
Currently, this means you can change the duration of a day/night for specific worlds.

As of right now, there are two commands: Schedule and World.
 /solar schedule
 The Schedule Command allows you to create and modify schedules that can be assigned to a world.
 A Schedule is made up of Cycles, a Cycle defines the time (in ticks) it takes for a day to occur, and how many days that cycle lasts.
 Schedules rotate robin-round through assigned cycles.

 /solar world
 The World Command allows you to view information about the current time of a world/worlds.
 It also allows you to change the schedule for a world.

How to install?
 Simply drop it into your plugins folder on your server, no leg-work needed.
